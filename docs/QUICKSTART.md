## Quickstart on Workflows

Currently there are 3 Seperate workflow paths:
1. Pure Analog Design
With the Pure Analog Design, you will most likely only need the analog/ directory, HOWEVER your Makefile would be modified removing the section:

```bash

```

2. Pure Digital Design
With the Pure Digital Design, you will most likely only need the digital/ directory, HOWEVER your Makefile would be modified removing the section:

```bash

```

Example Workflow:
```bash

```

3. Mixed-Signal Design
This repository would remain as is
